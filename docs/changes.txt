     could be not noticed.
   * Unicode: ConvertFromUCS4()/ConvertToUCS4() would not work with UTF-8 strings
   + ietf: Updated Namespaces of URN's with latest IANA list (2006-08-28)
   + extdos: Initial LINUX version

   + Added GetCurrentDirectory/SetCurrentDirectory in extdos
   * IETF: uri_split bugfix
   * strings: Speed optimisations

1.3.2:
   * Routine to replace unicode accented characters to their base equivalent  
   + ucs4_upcase 200% speed improvement
   + several speed optimizations in unicode unit
   + several speed optimizations in delphi strings unit
   * several bugfixes

1.3.1:
   * ucs4strpas would not work with ansistrings
   * ucs4strpastoutf8/convertUCS4ToUTF8: bugfix with possible overflow

1.3.0:
   + Delphi: DOS unit for Kylix
   + locale: MicrosoftCodePageToMIMECharset,MicrosoftLangageCodeToISOCode
   + unicode: desttype/srctype strings MIME types are no longer case sensitive.
   * unicode: Length was not set correctly in ConvertUCS4ToUTF8
   * unicode: ucs4strnewstr, length was incorrect with UTF-8 conversion
   * objects for Delphi: Major bugfix with TBufStream, some fields were
      not initialized.
   * Several minor bugfixes
   + dateutil: TDateInfo added (probably will be used later for the extended Date api)
   + ietf: uri parsing/validation routines

1.2.0:
   + more routines in dateutil that know about timezones 
     (extensions to base unit)
   + TryStrToDateTime() now knows about a lot of new
     date/time string representations (PDF,Openoffice,others).
   * several bugfixes, again with conversion of unicode
     strings.
   + ucs4strnewucs4/ucs4strtrim/ucs4strpastoutf8
   + IETF RFC 1766 language code parsing routines   
   * ISO 639: Now alternate names are recognized, and only
     the first alternate name is returned.
   + ISO 639: getlangcode_en and getlangcode_fr added; returns
     the 2 character language code, according on a language name.
   + Added FileIO unit, it is a standard file I/O API, similar
     to those of system, the main difference is that when it is
     compiled with the $DEBUG option, it indicates which files
     were not closed.
   + Adapted Delphi objects unit to use fileio routines.  
   - removed dpautils,tpautils,vpautils and fpautils from
